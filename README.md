## OpenStreetProject
I created this repo to house my work for the Open Street Map project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In this project, I downloaded Open Street Map data, audited several fields, cleaned the data while parsing the Open Street Map into to five CSV files, imported the CSVs to SQL tables, and used SQL to query the data. I chose Houston, Texas as my mapping area because it is where I started my first IT job after receiving my Associates Degree in Computer Technology. During the course of completing this project I consulted Stack Overflow, Udacity Data Wrangling course, and GitHub to help me work out the problems in my code.

This repo includes the following files:

README.md - This file, which contains a summary of files used for this project

Map_Area.txt - A text file that contains an explanation of why I chose the map area and a link to the map area.

OSM Project Final Report.pdf - A .pdf file explaning what I did in the report with screen shots of the code and output.

OSM Project Resources.txt - A text file that contains a list of the resources with links that I used to complete this project. 

OSM_To_CSV.py - file includes the origianol data.py file from Udacity. This code audits the data and cleans the data street names and postal codes.
Then the code takes the .osm file and shapes the data into 5 differenct .csv files.

create_DB.py - Creates a SQL database that can be queried to look at the data.
