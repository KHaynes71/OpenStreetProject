## OpenStreetProject
I created this repo to house my work for the Open Street Map project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In this project, I downloaded Open Street Map data, audited several fields, cleaned the data while parsing the Open Street Map into to five CSV files, imported the CSVs to SQL tables, and used SQL to query the data. I chose Houston, Texas as my mapping area because it is where I started my first IT job after receiving my Associates degree. During the course of completing this project I consulted Stack Overflow, Udacity Data Wrangling course, and GitHub to help me work out problems in my code.

##This repo includes the following files:

README.md: This file, which contains a summary of files used for this project
project_file.md: The final write-up documenting my data wrangling process and findings
street_names.py: The script used to clean the street names
state.py The script used to clean state values
zip_code.py The script used to clean zip codes
convert_xml_to_sql.py: The script that calls the above-mentioned functions to parse, clean the data, and output as CSVs
schema.py: The schema used for my SQL database
houston.osm: the file that I downloaded from OpenStreetMap
