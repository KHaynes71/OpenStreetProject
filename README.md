## OpenStreetProject
I created this repo to house my work for the Open Street Map project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In this project, I downloaded Open Street Map data, audited several fields, cleaned the data while parsing the Open Street Map into to five CSV files, imported the CSVs to SQL tables, and used SQL to query the data. I chose Houston, Texas as my mapping area because it is where I started my first IT job after receiving my Associates Degree in Computer Technology. During the course of completing this project I consulted Stack Overflow, Udacity Data Wrangling course, and GitHub to help me work out the problems in my code.

This repo includes the following files:
